# Changesets

This directory contains [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) which are used to generate changelogs and
manage version bumps.

When you make changes to the package, run `npx changeset` to create a new changeset file. This file should describe the
changes you've made and specify the appropriate version bump (patch, minor, or major).
